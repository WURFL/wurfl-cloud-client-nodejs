# ScientiaMobile WURFL Cloud Client for Node.js

The WURFL Cloud Service by ScientiaMobile, Inc., is a cloud-based
mobile device detection service that can quickly and accurately
detect over 500 capabilities of visiting devices.  It can differentiate
between portable mobile devices, desktop devices, SmartTVs and any 
other types of devices that have a web browser.

This is the Node.js Client for accessing the WURFL Cloud Service, and
it requires a free or paid WURFL Cloud account from ScientiaMobile:
http://www.scientiamobile.com/cloud 

## Installation
---------------

### Requirements
- Node.JS version 0.8.2

### Sign up for WURFL Cloud
First, you must go to http://www.scientiamobile.com/cloud and signup
for a free or paid WURFL Cloud account (see above).  When you've finished
creating your account, you must copy your API Key, as it will be needed in
the Client.

### Installation

**Via npm:**

    $ npm install wurflcloud

**Via Source:**

[Download the source code](https://github.com/WURFL/wurfl-cloud-client-nodejs/zipball/master) and
include the following lines in your code:

   	var wurfl_cloud_client = require("./NodeWurflCloudClient/WurflCloudClient");
	var config = require("./NodeWurflCloudClient/Config");

### Configuration
Set your API Key:

   	var api_key = "XXXXXX:YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY";
	var configuration = new config.WurflCloudConfig(api_key);

### Example
After you have installed and configured the WURFL Client, create example.js:

	var my_complete_device_name;
	var result_capabilities = {};
	var WURFLCloudClientObject = new wurfl_cloud_client.WurflCloudClient(configuration, HttpRequest, HttpResponse);
	WURFLCloudClientObject.detectDevice(HttpRequest, null, function(err, result_capabilities){
		WURFLCloudClientObject.getDeviceCapability('complete_device_name', function(error, my_complete_device_name){
			if(error!=null){
				console.log('Error' + error);
			}else{
				console.log('Complete Device Name: ' + my_complete_device_name);
			}
		});
	});				

You should see the complete device name of your device in the console provided
that you have already obtained a WURFL Cloud API key and that you have
selected `complete_device_name` in your capabilities section.


### Example application
After you have registered in WURFL Cloud Service [here](http://www.scientiamobile.com/cloud),
to run the example application on you browser do the following:

* Download and extract all the files in a folder.
* Inside the `exampleApp.js` enter your own WURFL Cloud api key.
* Select `complete_device_name` and `is_wireless_device` as your capabilities in ScientiaMobile WURFL Cloud website.
* Run the `server/example` application inside a console with `node index.js`.
* Go to a Web Browser in `http://localhost:8888`
* Either chose `example` or `example2`.

You will see the complete device name of your device and whether it is wireless or not.
